This is TechUp Ladies Group 1 project. Title of the project is GetSupport website that connects nonprofits and Small Medium Entreprise to Donors who are willing to support their business and non profit missions.

## GetSupport
This website solves the problem of funding sources, reduces third party interferences and increases one on one communication. 
we used react javascript for the coding and responsiveness of the site. we hope to implement a two factor authentication and chatbox in the site in the nearest future.
