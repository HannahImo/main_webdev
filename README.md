# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Hi there, 
This is TechUp Ladies Group 1 project. Title of the project is GetSupport website that connects nonprofits and Small Medium Entreprise to Donors who are willing to support their business and non profit missions.

## GetSupport
This website solves the problem of funding sources, reduces third party interferences and increases one on one communication. 
we used react javascript for the coding and responsiveness of the site. we hope to implement a two factor authentication and chatbox in the site in the nearest future.

## How to install and run the project
To run the demo web app offline, you need to install the following;

Make sure you have installed Node.js. Versions 6.0.0 and higher should work.
Make sure you have installed npm (NB: npm is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer).
Check that you have node and npm installed
To check if you have Node.js installed, run this command in your terminal:
node -v

To confirm that you have npm installed you can run this command in your terminal(command prompt):
npm -v
